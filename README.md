- - Day 1: Historian Hysteria - -
For the first challenge, we are given a list with two columns of digits. To get to the solution we need to open and read the given file, create pairs with the consecutive smaller number of each column, get the difference between each pair of values and sum them.

- - Day 2: Historian Hysteria - -
In the second challenge we are given a list with many rows of numbers (i.e. "20 21 24 25 27 29 27"). The objective here is to find how many of those rows are "safe", that means, the ones that follow some specific rules:
The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.
